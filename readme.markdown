Grepolis JSON API
=====================

This is a PHP based Grepolis JSON API. It gets the gZipped Grepolis CSV data from the specified world server and parses it into a useable JSON formate for client side consumption.

It also uses CORS to allow direct Javascript or JQuery request from remote domains.
